# Dice-Roller
A simple Python program that lets one roll their chances ranging from 1 to 6 and can keep going if they want up until they type in no. Run it in your command prompt.

# Guess
A program that comes up with a random number ranging from 1 to 3. If the value entered is too high it will tell you, same if it's too low. You have to keep guessing until you get the right number the program has generated for you! **(For testing purposes I do have the program printing the random value)**
